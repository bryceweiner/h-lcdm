TMDC Quantum Architecture Optimization Pipeline
===============================================

This pipeline implements a self-supervised machine learning system to discover
optimal twist angles for a 7-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)
quantum computing architecture based on the Quantum-Thermodynamic Entropy
Partition (QTEP) framework.
